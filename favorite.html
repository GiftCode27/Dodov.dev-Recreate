                My favorite number is 24, and today, on the 24th of December, I turn 24. Even though it's the dawn of Web 3.0, I decided to celebrate by giving myself the miracle of Web 1.0 — a blog.
            </p>

            <p>
                Now that we have my favorite number cleared up, I can tell you a little bit more about myself. My name's Hristiyan and I'm a software engineer at
                <a href="https://oblik.studio/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">  Oblik Studio</a>.
                I've studied computer science at
                <a href="https://www.elsys-bg.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"> ELSYS</a>  and have been messing with web development since 11, thanks to my dear childhood friends
                <a href="https://www.instagram.com/yordanoff/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"> Joro</a>  and 
               <a href="https://www.instagram.com/nequamx/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"> Vlady</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                I'm passionate about my work and enjoy spending time in a code editor, to the point that I've made my website look like one. And yes, the text you're currently reading has a line height of exactly 24 pixels. Although I have plenty of screen time, I know that's not optimal long-term, which is why I'm also interested in mental and physical health, nutrition, and improving my routine. I believe that teamwork between people is just as important as teamwork between your very own mind and body.
            </p>

            <p>
                In general, I like unraveling problems and getting to the bottom of things, sometimes to an annoying degree. I'm interested in anything from math, grammar, and Rubik's cubes to truly complex matters, such as vertical centering in CSS. I've also been bboying for over 10 years and salsa dancing lately as well. If I could have one superpower, it would be to clone myself, so I could do more stuff.
            </p>

            <p>I've gotten to where I am largely because of people on the internet who've shared their knowledge and experience. On this website, I want to share my own ideas, software development insights, random thoughts, and general life lessons I learn along the way. I believe that sharing this, as opposed to sharing drunk pictures with your friends, can actually make a worthwhile difference. So, Merry Christmas Eve, and if you're interested in what I have to say, you can increase my followers count on any of these data harvesting platforms:</p>
