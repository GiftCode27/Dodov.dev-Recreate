        </div>
        <div class="framework-3">
            <p>In 2019, I wanted to create a website that closely followed our custom design and had smooth
                animations and interactions. I looked at <a href="#">UIkit</a>, but I didn't pick it for two
                reasons:</p>
        </div>
        <div class="framework-4">

            <p><a href="#">-</a> It had its own opinion on design</p>
            <p><a href="#">-</a> It didn't meet my requirements for "smoothness"</p>

        </div>
        <div class="framework-5">
            <p>This lead me to search for other frameworks that, unlike UIkit, provide just the basic JavaScript
                functionality, allowing you to style and animate as you wish. I didn't find anything. So,
                naturally, I decided to make <a href="#">my own thing</a>.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="framework-6">
            <p>I was developing the framework in parallel with the website I was working on and it was wonderful. I
                was able to make the code just right and implement just the features I need. I took some
                inspiration from UIkit, but stuck to my main idea.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="framework-7">
            <p>Later, I noticed that things weren't very efficient, so I decided to refactor. But because I was
                developing that framework and simultaneously using it, I had to rework not only the framework,
                but the website as well. Apart from that, I was trying to make this work for as many use cases
                as I could. What if you use React? What if you don't? What if you use jQuery? What if you don't
                even know JavaScript that much?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="framework-8">
            <p>At this point, my enthusiasm slowly started to fade away. Without realizing it, I had put myself in a
                position where I wanted to solve problems that don't yet exist and solve them perfectly. But I
                still believed that in the end, it'd be "worth it".</p>
        </div>
        <div class="framework-9">
            <p>Then, our team started to grow. I was no longer the only one working on that website. Since it used
                my framework, I had to onboard new people with it. This meant that I had to write up a README,
                then documentation, example usage, etc. Despite that, we still had to clear up some stuff in Slack.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="framework-10">
            <p>Because our team grew, so did our workload. This caused work on the framework in parallel with the
                website to transition in work on the framework during the weekends and early mornings.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="framework-11">
            <p>I carried on, though. I had (and to this point, still have) the habit of abandoning projects, so I
                was determined to at least boil the framework down to small organized JavaScript snippets that
                you could download via npm. But do I use <a href="#">Custom Elements</a> or even go simpler than
                that and use just ES6 classes?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="framework-12">
            <p>Recently, I started getting more and more into the React ecosystem. Late to the party, I know. I also
                started noticing more websites with < div id="__next"> or __nuxt or ___gatsby. So no matter how I build
                    my framework, it wouldn't work with
                    the way most people build for the web. Since I want to start using these tools as well, my
                    framework won't work for me either.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="framework-13">
            <p>Unrelated to this, I had slowly started to pay more attention to my health and well-being. I
                changed my eating and sleeping habits, started to exercise and stretch more, I even started
                reading books… This made the weekends and early mornings much more packed and valuable.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="framework-14">
            <p>And now I'm here. I had made something that nobody really uses, but still represents a solid part
                of our workflow. What do I do? Well, I think I've learned some lessons in the past 3 years.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="framework-15">
            <h1>Code Doesn't Matter</h1>
            <P>Unless you're building software for aircraft or medical equipment, nobody really cares about your
                code, and neither should you. Especially in web development. At the end of the day, you want
                a bunch of boxes with text and images in them. You can have a hellish codebase and still get the
                job done. A perfect codebase doesn't exist. At least not for a very long time, in large
                projects, or with many people involved. Things will get messy and you should be ready to accept
                that.</P>
        </div>
        <div class="framework-16">
            <h1>Maintenance Is a Burden</h1>
            <p>Let's say you've built something and it works perfectly. That won't last long. Bugs will appear,
                new people will join and documentation will be needed, features will be requested. Who's
                going to handle that? If you're doing this as a side project, are you prepared to be
                distracted by these things while working? If not, are you prepared to do them in your free time?
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="framework-17">
            <p>Even if people start contributing with pull requests and taking some of that load off of you,
                you'll still have to review and approve of what's going on.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="framework-18">
            <h1>Third-Party Is Fine</h1>
            <p>If you find someone else who has done the work for you, use it. There might be things that you
                don't like, but compared to the hidden costs of maintaining something yourself, they won't
                matter. If that third-party code has been out for a long time, chances are that most common
                bugs and edge cases would have already been handled. Doing things yourself should be your last
                resort, because you'll slowly discover the same issues as well and waste time on solved
                problems.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="framework-19">
            <h1>Launch Early</h1>
            <p>On the off-chance that you really want or have to build something, launch it as soon as you can.
                As David Heinemeier Hansson said on <a href="#">episode "Launch Now" of the Rework podcast:</a>
            </p>
            <p class="a-class">> If you're not uncomfortable by the time you're launching,</p>
            <p class="a-class">> it's way too late.</p>     
        </div>
        <div class="framework-20">
            <p>I never really launched my side project. It wasn't "ready". At the same time, it became a bigger
                and bigger dependency in our main projects. That's an issue, because you're building on top of
                something that isn't validated by other people. If I had shared it, maybe people would have
                helped out and given ideas for improvements. Or, maybe people would have critiqued it and made
                me question whether it's valuable.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="framework-21">
            <p>And that's what I was most afraid of — that the project isn't valuable. But no matter how much
                effort you put into something, you still can't know for sure if it's valuable until other
                people give their own points of view. That's why it's better to launch as soon as possible:
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="framework-22">
                <p><a href="#">-</a>  If you've built something valuable, you'll get more like-minded people to help you out with
                    it</p><br>
                <p><a href="#">-</a>  If you've built something pointless, you'll save time and probably learn about new and
                    better approaches</p>
        </div>
        <div class="framework-23">
            <h1>Conclusion</h1>
            <p>I will archive my project. These problems have already been solved by many people, many times. We
                all know that <a href="#">every day, a new JavaScript framework is born</a>. This happens
                because people like me think they've got the silver bullet and can solve a certain problem
                once and for all. But that's impossible and delusional. It's like that <a href="#">xkcd comic
                    about standards</a>:</p>
        </div>
        <div class="framework-24">
            <img src="images/standards.png" alt="">
        </div>
        <div class="framework-25">
            <p>We should work on solving new problems, not existing ones. If you find an issue with someone
                else's code, report it or directly submit a pull request and fix it. Not just for yourself, but
                for everybody else! Your contributions will be nicely welcomed! Don't create something new
                with its own set of problems.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="framework-26">
            <p>It's impossible to build something entirely by yourself. At some point, your "pristine" code will
                have to interact with other people's "messy" code. Sure, you might not use third-party code
                on your website, but its existence still depends on it. The operating system it runs on is
                not built by you. The browser that your viewers use to see it is not built by you. The protocols
                that carry your data across the wire are not designed by you.
            </p>
            <p >You will always depend on other people's work. Embrace that!</p>
