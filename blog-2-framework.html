    <div class="prow-3">
        <p>In 2019, I wanted to create a website that closely followed our <br>custom design and had smooth animations and interactions. <br>I looked at <a href="#">UIkit</a>, but I didn't pick it for two reasons:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="prow-4">
        <ul>
            <li>It had its own opinion on design</li>
            <li>It didn't meet my requirements for "smoothness"</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="prow-5">
        <p>This lead me to search for other frameworks that, unlike UIkit, <br>provide just the basic JavaScript functionality, allowing you to <br>style and animate as you wish. I didn't find anything. So, <br>naturally, I decided to make <a href="#">my own thing</a>.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="prow-6">
        <p>I was developing the framework in parallel with the website I was <br>working on and it was wonderful. I was able to make the code just <br>right and implement just the features I need. I took some <br>inspiration from UIkit, but stuck to my main idea.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="prow-7">
        <p>Later, I noticed that things weren't very efficient, so I decided <br>to refactor. But because I was developing that framework and <br>simultaneously using it, I had to rework not only the framework, <br>but the website as well. Apart from that, I was trying to make <br>this work for as many use cases as I could. What if you use <br>React? What if you don't? What if you use jQuery? What if you <br>don't even know JavaScript that much?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="prow-8">
        <p>At this point, my enthusiasm slowly started to fade away. Without <br>realizing it, I had put myself in a position where I wanted to <br>solve problems that don't yet exist and solve them perfectly. But <br>I still believed that in the end, it'd be "worth it".</p>
    </div>
    <div class="row-9">
        <p>Then, our team started to grow. I was no longer the only one <br>working on that website. Since it used my framework, I had to <br>onboard new people with it. This meant that I had to write up a <br>README, then documentation, example usage, etc. Despite that, we <br>still had to clear up some stuff in Slack.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="row-10">
        <p>Because our team grew, so did our workload. This caused work on <br>the framework in parallel with the website to transition in work <br>on the framework during the weekends and early mornings.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="row-11">
        <p>I carried on, though. I had (and to this point, still have) the <br>habit of abandoning projects, so I was determined to at least <br>boil the framework down to small organized JavaScript snippets <br>that you could download via npm. But do I use <a href="#">Custom Elements</a> or <br>even go simpler than that and use just ES6 classes?</p>
    </div>      
    <div class="row-12">
        <p>Recently, I started getting more and more into the React <br>ecosystem. Late to the party, I know. I also started noticing <br>more websites with <div id="__next"> or __nuxt or ___gatsby. So <br>no matter how I build my framework, it wouldn't work with the way <br>most people build for the web. Since I want to start using these <br>tools as well, my framework won't work for me either.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="row-13">
        <p>Unrelated to this, I had slowly started to pay more attention to <br>my health and well-being. I changed my eating and sleeping <br>habits, started to exercise and stretch more, I even started <br>reading books… This made the weekends and early mornings much <br>more packed and valuable.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="row-14">
        <p>And now I'm here. I had made something that nobody really uses, <br>but still represents a solid part of our workflow. What do I do?<br> Well, I think I've learned some lessons in the past 3 years.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="row-15">
        <h1>Code Doesn't Matter</h1>
        <P>Unless you're building software for aircraft or medical <br>equipment, nobody really cares about your code, and neither <br>should you. Especially in web development. At the end of the day, <br>you want a bunch of boxes with text and images in them. You can <br>have a hellish codebase and still get the job done. A perfect <br>codebase doesn't exist. At least not for a very long time, in <br>large projects, or with many people involved. Things will get <br>messy and you should be ready to accept that.</P>
    </div>
    <div class="row-16">
        <h1>Maintenance Is a Burden</h1>
        <p>Let's say you've built something and it works perfectly. That <br>won't last long. Bugs will appear, new people will join and <br>documentation will be needed, features will be requested. Who's <br>going to handle that? If you're doing this as a side project, are <br>you prepared to be distracted by these things while working? If <br>not, are you prepared to do them in your free time?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="row-17">
        <p>Even if people start contributing with pull requests and taking <br>some of that load off of you, you'll still have to review and <br>approve of what's going on.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="row-18">
        <h1>Third-Party Is Fine</h1>
        <p>If you find someone else who has done the work for you, use it. <br>There might be things that you don't like, but compared to the <br>hidden costs of maintaining something yourself, they won't <br>matter. If that third-party code has been out for a long time, <br>chances are that most common bugs and edge cases would have <br>already been handled. Doing things yourself should be your last <br>resort, because you'll slowly discover the same issues as well <br>and waste time on solved problems.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="row-19">
        <h1>Launch Early</h1>
        <p>On the off-chance that you really want or have to build <br>something, launch it as soon as you can. As David Heinemeier <br>Hansson said on <a href="#">episode "Launch Now" of the Rework podcast:</a></p>
        <ul>
            <li>If you're not uncomfortable by the time you're launching,</li>
            <li>it's way too late.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="row-20">
        <p>I never really launched my side project. It wasn't "ready". At <br>the same time, it became a bigger and bigger dependency in our <br>main projects. That's an issue, because you're building on top of <br>something that isn't validated by other people. If I had shared <br>it, maybe people would have helped out and given ideas for <br>improvements. Or, maybe people would have critiqued it and made <br>me question whether it's valuable.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="row-21">
        <p>And that's what I was most afraid of — that the project isn't <br>valuable. But no matter how much effort you put into something, <br>you still can't know for sure if it's valuable until other <br>people give their own points of view. That's why it's better to <br>launch as soon as possible:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="row-22">
        <u>
            <li>If you've built something valuable, you'll get more like-<br>minded people to help you out with it</li>
            <li>If you've built something pointless, you'll save time and <br>probably learn about new and better approaches</li>
        </u>
    </div>
    <div class="row-23">
        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        <p>I will archive my project. These problems have already been <br>solved by many people, many times. We all know that <a href="#">every day, a <br>new JavaScript framework is born</a>. This happens because people <br>like me think they've got the silver bullet and can solve a <br>certain problem once and for all. But that's impossible and <br>delusional. It's like that <a href="#">xkcd comic about standards</a>:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="row-24">
        <img src="images/standards.png" alt="">
    </div>
    <div class="row-25">
        <p>We should work on solving new problems, not existing ones. If you <br>find an issue with someone else's code, report it or directly <br>submit a pull request and fix it. Not just for yourself, but for <br>everybody else! Your contributions will be nicely welcomed! Don't <br>create something new with its own set of problems.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="row-26">
        <p>It's impossible to build something entirely by yourself. At some <br>point, your "pristine" code will have to interact with other <br>people's "messy" code. Sure, you might not use third-party code <br>on your website, but its existence still depends on it. The <br>operating system it runs on is not built by you. The browser that <br>your viewers use to see it is not built by you. The protocols <br>that carry your data across the wire are not designed by you.</p>
        <p>You will always depend on other people's work. Embrace that!</p>
