          This could happen when there are multiple layers of
          <a href="#" class="glink">caching</a> in <br />play and one of them has not expired.
          If you've used something<br />like <a href="#" class="glink">Cloudflare CDN</a>,
          you've likely ran into this.

        <h2>What is Browser Caching?</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="gdiv2">
        <p>
          Let's say your website has a logo in the header and it appears on<br />
          all pages. When users land on your website and start browsing,<br />they'll
          be downloading the same logo on every page load. This<br />
          inefficiency increases bandwidth costs and load times.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="gdiv3">
        <p>
          When sending the logo to the user, your server can also provide<br />
          the <a href="#"><span class="gorange">Cache-Control</span> <span class="glink">response header</span></a> with an expiration value like<br />
          <span class="gorange">max-‍age=604800</span>. This will tell the browser to store the logo<br />
          locally, on the user's hard drive, for 604800 seconds, which is 7<br />
          days. Until that time passes, whenever your website references<br />
          the logo through the same URL, the user's browser will use its<br />
          cached version. After that, the browser will request the logo<br />
          from your server once again and cache it for another 7 days.

      <div class="gdiv2"><h2>What is an Edge?</h2></div>
      <div class="gdiv2">

          If your audience is mainly European, it would probably make sense<br />
          to put your server in London, for example. But if your website<br />
          starts receiving traffic from America, those requests would have<br />
          to travel an entire ocean, which can make them several times<br />
          slower, due to <a href="#" class="glink">latency</a>. With a <a href="#" class="glink">CDN</a>,
          you have a system of servers<br />
          spread throughout the world that <a href="#" class="glink">proxy</a> user traffic to
          your<br />
          server and <a href="#" class="glink">solve this performance issue</a>.

      </div>
      <div class="gdiv2">
        <p>
          Among the <a href="#" class="glink">hundreds of servers</a> in a CDN, the
          geographically<br />
          closest one to a user is called an edge and is the one that this<br />
          user's browser directly communicates with:

        <h2 class="gdiv2">What is Edge Caching?</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="gdiv2">
        <p>
          While browser caching helps with many requests by the same user,<br />
          it doesn't solve the issue of many users making requests, because<br />
          each user has their own browser with their own cache. To fix<br />
          this, you need a shared cache.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="gdiv2">
        <p>
          With a CDN, all user requests are funneled through the closest<br />
          edge server. If that server caches the responses, it'll be able<br />
          to serve those users without having to bother your own server.<br />
          This means that it no longer matters if you have 1 user or 10000,<br />
          because once that first response for a resource is served and<br />
          cached, the load shifts from your server to the CDN, which can<br />
          serve the other 9999 by itself.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="gdiv2">
        <p>
          Cloudflare caches only static assets <a href="#" class="glink">by default</a>, such
          as images,<br />
          fonts, scripts, etc. The HTML containing the page content is not<br />
          cached, because if you have an e-commerce store, for example,<br />
          each user will have their own shopping cart, and if you cache<br />
          that, the next user will see the previous one's items. On the<br />
          other hand, an image is expected to be the same for every user<br />
          and can safely be cached.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="gdiv3">
        <p>
          Sites without shopping carts and other dynamic content, such as<br />
          blogs, can opt in to <a href="#" class="glink">cache everything</a>. This makes it
          possible for<br />
          an edge to serve entire pages all by itself, without having to<br />
          contact your server, as long as everything is cached. This way,<br />
          you can have a very weak server, yet handle thousands of requests<br />
          per second, because the load is mainly on the CDN.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="gdiv2"><h2>Cache Invalidation</h2></div>
      <div class="gdiv2">
        <p>
          The hard part in caching is picking a
          <a href="#" class="glink">time to live (TTL)</a>, which<br />
          determines when an entry is stale and should be discarded.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="gdiv2">
        <p>
          Images and other assets can be cached for longer periods, because<br />
          even if you pick a way too long TTL, you can change the URL to<br />
          the resource and trigger a fresh request-response cycle:
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="ghash">
        <div><a href="#" class="hash">#</a></div>
        <div><p class="gscroll">https://example.com/about-us/image.jpg?version=2</p></div>
      </div>
      <div class="gdiv2">
        <p>
          However, if you've chosen to cache the HTML content of<br />
          your pages as well, you'd have to get around that too,<br />
          since changing the image URL means changing the HTML. So<br />
          you'd have to change the page URL as well:
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="ghash">
        <div><a href="#" class="hash">#</a></div>
        <div><p class="gscroll">https://example.com/about-us?version=2</p></div>
      </div>
      <div class="gdiv2">
        <p>
          This is where things get tricky, because even if your web<br />
          framework can easily change all links to the updated page,<br />
          <strong>every other site on the internet</strong> also has to do it.
          That's<br />
          impossible, so you have to pick a window of time that<br />
          you're comfortable with and in which users may see<br />
          outdated content.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="gdiv2"><p>If you have the following setup:</p></div>
      <div class="gdiv2">
        <ul>
          <li>Browser cache TTL: <strong>30 minutes</strong></li>
          <li>Edge cache TTL: <strong>1 minute</strong></li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="gdiv2"><p>…there are several possible outcomes:</p></div>
      <div>
        <ol>
          <li class="gdiv2">
            If a change happened <strong>over 30 minutes ago</strong>, both
            caches<br />
            would have expired and it's guaranteed that the user<br />
            will see the updated version.
          </li>
          <li class="gdiv2">
            If a change happened <strong>over 1 minute ago</strong>, only the
            edge<br />
            cache is guaranteed to have expired. If a user has seen<br />
            the page within the last 30 minutes and is cached by<br />
            their browser, they can see the change by clearing<br />
            their browser cache, opening an incognito window, or<br />
            doing a <a href="#" class="glink">hard reload</a>.
          </li>
          <li class="gdiv3">
            If a change happened <strong>less than 1 minute ago</strong>,
            both<br />
            caches would still be considered fresh. Users will not<br />
            be able to see the update,
            <strong
              >even if they clear their<br />
              browser cache</strong
            >, because the closest edge server would<br />
            still return the old version. The only solution here is<br />
            for the website owner to prematurely force the cache to<br />
            become stale by <a href="#" class="glink">purging it</a>.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <div class="gdiv2"><h2>Conclusion</h2></div>
      <div class="gdiv2">
        <p>
          <strong>Browser cache</strong> helps with subsequent requests by the
          same<br />
          user and makes your website feel snappy, because your<br />
          assets don't have to travel over the internet.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="gdiv2">
        <p>
          <strong>Edge cache</strong> helps with requests by a geographically
          close group of users and can greatly reduce server load while
          improving response times in distant countries.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="gdiv2">
        <p>
          Pick a lower TTL to reduce the chance of outdated content, or a higher
          TTL for better cache effectiveness, but be ready to change URLs, open
          incognito windows, and purge cache.
